abstract: Explore our six tutorials on Automatic Text Recognition (ATR) and
  learn how to efficiently extract full text from heritage material images.
  Perfectly tailored for researchers, librarians, and archivists, these
  resources not only enhance your archival research and preservation efforts but
  also unlock the potential for computational analysis of your sources. The
  tutorials, available in English, German, and French, are designed to be
  concise and accessible to scholars who may not be prepared to immediately
  engage with and apply complex technical documentation.
